Accelerated Engineering Degree (ACCEND)
The Accelerated Engineering Degree (ACCEND) program is a great opportunity to enhance your education by earning a bachelor's and master's degree in 5 years. 
Generally, approval for the ACCEND program takes place after the completion of two academic semesters and is based on your academic record.  Some select students may be invited to join earlier.
APPLY HANDBOOK
I have not decided whether or not I would like to pursue a PhD or to try and find a job in the market, but the ACCEND program has given me the educational foundation to pursue either route with confidence.
 Joe Wright, ACCEND Student
How is the program set up?
In order to accelerate the completion of the undergraduate degree, there are four primary means used:
AP Credit that satisfies curricular requirements
Completion of college level courses while in high school
Register for an on-line course during co-op term
Participation in Cooperative Education for four, rather than five, terms in order to complete an additional academic semester
What graduate degrees are available in ACCEND?
Master of Science (MS)
The ACCEND programs that offer an undergraduate degree in engineering along with the Master of Science in an engineering discipline will appeal to students interested in research and greater depth in a particular engineering field.
These students often go on to PhD programs or work in fields that require more specialized knowledge. The MS ACCEND track culminates in a research experience and thesis.
Master of Science (MS) Cosmetic Science
The ACCEND program offers an undergraduate degree in chemical engineering along with the Master of Science in Cosmetic Science at the James L. Winkle College of Pharmacy. 
Costmetic Science Requirements
Master of Business Administration (MBA)
The ACCEND programs that offer an undergraduate degree in engineering along with the Master of Business Administration at the Lindner College of Business will appeal to students who want to understand both the technical side of an organization and the business aspects of the organization. Students seek this program because it increases their value to an organization and prepares them to take on a management role earlier in their careers. Tuition and fees for the MBA program through ACCEND are managed by the Lindner College of Business. Students should discuss costs with an LCB advisor.
Master of Engineering (MEng)
The ACCEND programs that offer an undergraduate degree in engineering along with the Master of Engineering will appeal to students interested in greater breadth in engineering and want to focus on the practice of engineering.
These students often are seeking pragmatic skills and knowledge that will allow them to improve the contribution they make to a technical organization. The MEng provides a traditional coursework based master’s and does not include a thesis component.
Master of Education in Curriculum & Instruction (MEd)
The ACCEND programs that offer an undergraduate degree in engineering along with the Master of Curriculum and Instruction will appeal to students who have an interest in teaching in high school, middle school, or possibly community college.
The program provides the rigorous technical education of the engineering degree along with the teaching skills and certifications needed to work in education.
Juris Doctorate (J.D.)
The ACCEND programs that offer an undergraduate degree in engineering along with a Juris Doctorate (J.D.) in Law will appeal to students who want to enter the legal profession.  Engineer-attorneys can sit for the patent bar, and are also well-equipped to handle many other transactional or litigation matters that center upon technical issues.  (Students will not be able to complete JD at the same time as their bachelor’s degree.  However, they can complete 15-30 credits of the 90 credit hour degree prior to BS graduation.)
Adding the MS, MEng, or MBA program
Applying to the MS, MEng, or MBA program
ACCEND Students must have an open graduate program so graduate courses count toward that degree.  That requires ACCEND students apply to the Graduate School prior to taking any graduate level courses. Students should apply to the graduate program the semester before they are ready to take their first graduate course.  Instructions for applying to the Graduate program are provided below.  Both the undergraduate and the graduate programs will be open – students will register for graduate classes in the graduate career, and undergraduate classes in the undergraduate career.
Important Billing Information
When a student registers for 6 or fewer graduate level semester hours, tuition and fees will be at the undergraduate level.
When a student registers for 7 or more graduate level semester hours, tuition and fees will be at the graduate level.
Course planning is of critical importance. Students should take no more than 6 grad credits any semester prior to the 5th year

Graduation
You will need to apply to graduate from both programs and you will pay the graduation fee twice
You cannot graduate from your Graduate Program before you graduate with your undergraduate degree, but you can graduate from both programs in the same term, or your BS program one term, and your MS, MENG, or MBA a later term

                            UC expert helps museum&#39;s &#39;Pompeii&#39; come to life
                    February 13, 2024
                    University of Cincinnati Classics Professor Steven Ellis last year published the first of four historical volumes on his work as director of excavations at Pompeii’s Porta Stabia neighborhood. Now he is lending his expertise to a new exhibit on Pompeii at the Cincinnati Museum Center. “Pompeii: The Exhibition” opens at the museum on Feb. 16. It features 150 priceless artifacts from the ancient city.

                            Cuteness overload
                    February 12, 2024
                    Tears of joy. Playful bites of a partner. A baby who’s so cute you just want to pinch him. Those physical displays of what might look like aggression actually signal intense love. And they are perfectly normal, says Oriana Aragon, PhD, a UC social psychologist and assistant professor of marketing who coined the term &#34;cute aggression.&#34;

    Scholarships &amp; Financial Aid at the University of Cincinnati
    At the University of Cincinnati, we believe all students should have equal opportunities to receive a quality education, regardless of income        Financial Aid
    Did you know nearly all students are eligible for financial assistance? Financial aid can be provided in the form of scholarships, grants, work-study and loans. At UC, we take it one step further by allowing students to also offset costs through paid co-op experiences.
        FAFSA Explained
    The only application necessary in the financial aid process is the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The FAFSA opens on October 1 before the upcoming academic year and must be completed annually. We recommend completing it as soon as possible, as it determines your eligibility for the following:
Grants — Grants are funds that are awarded based on financial need.
Work-Study — Work-study programs are need-based employment opportunities that allow you to work and earn money to help fund your education.
Loans — Loans are borrowed money that must be repaid. There are various types of loans that may be included in your financial aid offer.
Your financial aid offer may include any or a combination of the above funding sources. To see if you’re eligible for financial aid, view the requirements.

        Scholarships
    Scholarships at the University of Cincinnati are funds that are awarded to students toward their academic careers. They are based on academic achievements or other merit-based criteria and do not need to be repaid. The two types of scholarships at UC are:
Internal Scholarships: Internal scholarships are generally UC funds. They are awarded to incoming freshmen students, transfer students, and graduate students.
External Scholarships: External scholarships are scholarships awarded to students from organizations outside of UC. There are billions of dollars of external scholarship money available to students of all qualifications, abilities, and interests.
        How to Apply for Scholarships
    Traditional freshmen applying to the University of Cincinnati are automatically considered for all scholarships they are eligible for through the online UC application. 
To apply for external scholarships, we encourage current students to take advantage of our new “Scholarship Search” tile in Catalyst to get matched and apply to external scholarships.
    We’re committed to creating opportunities for Cincinnati Public School (CPS) students that support college readiness, access and success. Visit UC's CPS Strong initiative to learn more about scholarships and grants available for CPS students.

        Offset Cost with UC’s Co-op Program
    The University of Cincinnati Co-op Program allows students to jumpstart their careers and cut costs. With education-based learning at its core, students who co-op earn credit toward their degree while working paid jobs in their field of study. 
Some of the ways cooperative education will reduce your student loans while you’re still in college include: 
Gaining on-the-job experience and making connections
Earning money while in college with the opportunity to graduate earlier
Increasing employability by building an impressive resume
Currently, there are over 7,800 paid student Co-op opportunities provided by 2,567 industry partners. UC students have collectively earned $76 million in Co-op earnings.
    Co-op at the University of Cincinnati
        I loved that my semesters alternated between co-oping and taking classes. It allowed me to learn new material in class to apply to my next co-op, and then gain real working experience to take back and apply to my studies. I can confidently interview for a full-time position, knowing exactly how I want to start my career as a young professional.

        About this example
    It's important to note that each UC student's cost is individually calculated based on factors such as program of study, financial aid award, meal plan, housing selections and more. This example, while including real numbers, may not reflect your exact cost.  
Tuition &amp; Fees are calculated based on Ohio Resident rates. View all rates for tuition and fees. For eligible students, your tuition won't increase while continuously enrolled thanks to UC's Tuition Guarantee.
Housing costs calculated based on traditional multiple occupancy room. View all rates for housing. 
Meal plan costs are calculated based on the required All-Access plan for incoming freshmen. Other years represent lower selected meal plan options. Remember, your meal plan needs may change based on your co-op schedule. View all meal plan rates.
Co-op earnings are calculated based on average hourly wages, working 35 hours per week for 15 weeks. Find out how much you can earn from co-op. 
Scholarship earnings are calculated based on average student award. You may qualify for more scholarship aid from UC and outside scholarship sources. 
        Scholarships and Aid FAQs
            Do scholarships affect financial aid?&nbsp;
        
        
    Any scholarship you receive may or may not impact your ability to obtain additional financial aid. The Student Financial Aid Office must be aware of any scholarship you are receiving. It is important for awarded students to understand the scholarship limits of offers made to them.
            Can you get scholarships and financial aid at the same time?&nbsp;
        
        
    Yes, students can receive scholarships and financial aid at the same time. However, any scholarship you receive may or may not impact your ability to obtain additional financial aid. The One Stop Center and the Student Financial Aid Office must be aware of any scholarship you are receiving.
            What is the difference between scholarships, financial aid, loans and grants?&nbsp;
        
        
Financial aid: Any form of financial assistance used to help fund your college education. 
Scholarships: Scholarships are funds awarded to students based on academic merit that do not need to be repaid. 
Grants: Grants are funds awarded to students based on financial need that do not need to be repaid. 
Loans: Loans are borrowed money granted through the FAFSA that must be repaid.
            What scholarships and financial aid are available for international students?&nbsp;
        
        
    The University of Cincinnati Global Scholarship is exclusively for international undergraduate applicants. Awards range from $1,000 to $15,000 each year and are renewable for up to four academic years.
            What is the Cincinnati Tuition Guarantee?&nbsp;
        
        
    The Cincinnati Tuition Guarantee is a cohort-based program that sets tuition, mandatory fees, and room and board at a consistent rate for up to four or five years depending on the length of a student's academic program. Degree-seeking first-year and transfer students enrolling at our Uptown or regional campuses are eligible.
